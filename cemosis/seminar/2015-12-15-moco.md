We will present some results in computational cardiac electrophysiology. First, we introduce the mathematical and numerical models of electrophysiology and we provide simulations that are validated against various qualitative and quantitative criteria found in the medical literature. Since our model takes into account atria and ventricles, we are able to reproduce full cycle Electrocardiograms (ECG) in healthy configurations and also in several pathological cases.

Then, since the equations that describe the electrical activity of the heart can be very demanding from a computational point of view, few reduced order methods are investigated. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method is applied for the discretization of the electrophysiology equations in different configurations, as for instance the simulation of a myocardial infarction. To circumvent some limitations of the POD method, an innovative reduced order method based on the Approximated Lax Pairs (ALP) is investigated.
